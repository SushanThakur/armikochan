# Armikochan - Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the repository for **Armikochan**, my hobby project featuring a custom-designed robotic arm. This repo contains the source code and 3D model files for the project.

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code**: The main code for controlling the robotic arm is located in the `1_main_arm_code/` directory.
- **3D Model**: The 3D model files for the arm are included in the repository. To explore the model, I recommend cloning the entire repo rather than downloading individual files.
- **Documentation**: For a detailed explanation of how the arm works, check out the `5_documentation/Documentation.pdf` file.

## About the Project

Armikochan is a personal project where I handled all aspects of the design, including the mechanical structure, electronics, and programming. As a hobby project, there's plenty of room for improvement, and I welcome your suggestions!

## Get Involved

If you're interested in building a similar robotic arm or have questions, feel free to reach out! You can contact me at [mail@sushant.uk](mailto:mail@sushant.uk). I'd be happy to assist or collaborate.
