This is the repo for the source code and 3D-Model of my robotic arm project named 'Armikochan'.

The main code for robotic arm is in the receiver/ dir.

If you want to see the 3D-Model youself, consider cloning this whole repo instead of just downloading specific part.

I have explained the working of this arm in a word file named 'Armikochan.docx', you can check that out for complete understanding.

This was more of a hobby project and I did all of the designing, coding, electronic parts by my self and I understand that there are so many room for improvements. Feel free to suggest.

Leave me an E-mail if you want to make something like this yourself at mail@sushant.uk 

I would be more than happy to help.
