# Armikochan - Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the **Armikochan** repository! This is my hobby project showcasing a custom-designed robotic arm, complete with source code and 3D model files.

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code**: The primary code for controlling the robotic arm is located in the `1_main_arm_code/` directory.
- **3D Model**: The 3D model files for the arm are included in the repo. For the best experience, clone the entire repository rather than downloading individual files.
- **Documentation**: A detailed explanation of the arm's functionality is available in `5_documentation/Documentation.pdf`. Note: The documentation was written without APA formatting, so it may appear informal. Apologies for any unprofessional presentation!

## About the Project

Armikochan is a solo endeavor where I designed the mechanical structure, electronics, and software from scratch. As a hobby project, it’s a work in progress with plenty of opportunities for enhancement. I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions!
